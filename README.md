  ## Description
  This application uses Node.js with object oriented programming fundamentals to interact with a user through the command line and generate a styled html page of members of a work team. This application uses inquirer for the prompt question, and tests using Jest were set up for this project as well. In the end, a user will have a clean looking (with bootstrap framework) html page to see information specific to their employees.

  1. In your command line, navigate to the root folder of this application. 
  2. Run the command 'node index.js' to initialize the Team Profile Generator. 
  3. Follow the series of prompts on the screen to add employees to the page. 
  4. When you choose not to add any more employees, you will see a listing of the employee details you submitted, followed by confirmation of the files created in the dist folder. 
  5. Copy BOTH of the newly created style.css and index.html pages from the dist folder to the desired folder for your usage, making sure they are in the same folder for the styles to work with the html page.
